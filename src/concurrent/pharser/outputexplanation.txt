Phaser phaser=new Phaser(1), Creates a new phaser with 1 registered unArrived parties and initial phase number is 0.

 first - New unarrived party has been registered with phaser
second - New unarrived party has been registered with phaser
third - New unarrived party has been registered with phaser
We have created 3 MyRunnable objects and in MyRunnableâ€™s constructor all 3 new unarrived party has been registered with phaser.

--------Phaser has started---------------

 main thread has called arriveAndAwaitAdvance() and waiting for another 3 registered parties (Thread-1, Thread-2 and Thread-3) to call arriveAndAwaitAdvance().

 Thread-1 - party has arrived and is working in Phase-0
Thread-1 (party) has called arriveAndAwaitAdvance() and waiting for other 2 registered parties to call arriveAndAwaitAdvance()

 Thread-2 - party has arrived and is working in Phase-0
Thread-2 (one more party) has called arriveAndAwaitAdvance() and waiting for other 1 registered party to call arriveAndAwaitAdvance()

 Thread-3 - party has arrived and is working in Phase-0
Now, all registered parties have called arriveAndAwaitAdvance(), main thread can resume.

 ------Phase-0 has been COMPLETED----------
As, all registered parties have called arriveAndAwaitAdvance(), main thread has resumed.


Thread-3 - party has arrived and is working in Phase-1
Thread-2 - party has arrived and is working in Phase-1
Thread-1 - party has arrived and is working in Phase-1

 After working in phase-1 all the registered threads calls arriveAndAwaitAdvance() and than calls arriveAndDeregister(), now only main thread is registered with phaser.

------Phase-1 has been COMPLETED----------

 Main thread has called arriveAndAwaitAdvance() and then called arriveAndDeregister(), now there is no thread registered with phaser.

 Phaser has been terminated
As, there is no thread registered with phaser now, phaser has terminated.
